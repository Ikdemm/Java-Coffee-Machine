# Java-Coffee-Machine

This project is a solution for a problem proposed by JetBrains Academy.
The project is composed of a single main Java Class that simulates a Coffee Machine's behavior.

## Actions

The program should repeatedly ask what the user wants to do. If the user types "buy", "fill" or "take". 
If the user wants to switch off the coffee machine, he should type "exit". Then the program should terminate. 
Also, when the user types "remaining", the program should output all the resources that the coffee machine has.

if the user types "buy" to buy a cup of coffee and then changes his mind, he should be able to type "back" to return into the main cycle.

## Resources

The machine has a limited supply of water, milk, coffee beans, and disposable cups.
Also, it counts how much money it gets for selling coffee. 
If the coffee machine doesnâ€™t have enough resources to make coffee, the program should output a message that says it can't make a cup of coffee.

## Coffees

For the espresso, the coffee machine needs 250 ml of water and 16 g of coffee beans. It costs $4.
For the latte, the coffee machine needs 350 ml of water, 75 ml of milk, and 20 g of coffee beans. It costs $7.
And for the cappuccino, the coffee machine needs 200 ml of water, 100 ml of milk, and 12 g of coffee. It costs $6.
